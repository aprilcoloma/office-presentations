1. Typography
    1. Don't mix sans-serif with serif fonts / Don't use too many type faces (using too many can be distracting / for more readability balance)
    2. Headlines/Titles will need to be set with a greater font-size
    3. Set the right line-height for readability reasons (Leading = font height + 2 px)
    4. Choosing the right font color (text should be readable enough, contrast is the key, white font and dark gray background color)

    5. Be consistent with your alignment (left aligned headings, left aligned text)

2. Space in Web Design
    1. Creates groupings of elements
    2. Creates emphasis and hierarchy
    3. Improves legibility
